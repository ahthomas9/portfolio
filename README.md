# Portfolio
A single-page portfolio displaying finished and current projects--whatever they may be. Has a welcome section (using [baffle](https://camwiegert.github.io/baffle/) for the scramble animation), about me section with soft skills and language/techonolgy experiences shown, followed by the projects themselves with images showing the sites, and then finally a contact form with social links at the bottom. Each sections fades in/out on scroll.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Libraries
- Bootstrap 3
- jQuery
- baffle.js

### Tools

## Personal Benefits
It was definitely a challenge to see how to go about checking viewports and whether or not an element was in it. Viewing source-code of similar projects assisted greatly and led me to the right layouts of code and how best to format.
